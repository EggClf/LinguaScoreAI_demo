Test takers at level 8 can also use spoken language to answer questions and give basic information. Their pronunciation and intonation and stress are at all times highly intelligible.",

They can express opinions or respond to complicated requests effectively. In extended responses, some of the following weaknesses may sometimes occur, but they do not interfere with the message: minor difficulties with pronunciation, intonation or hesitation when creating language; some errors when using complex grammatical structures; some imprecise vocabulary. Test takers at level 7 can also use spoken language to answer questions and give basic information. When reading aloud, test takers at level 7 are highly intelligible.",

However, at least part of the time, the reasons for, or explanations of, the opinion are unclear to a listener. This may be because of the following: unclear pronunciation or inappropriate intonation or stress when the speaker must create language; mistakes in grammar; a limited range of vocabulary. Most of the time, test takers at level 6 can answer questions and give basic information. However, sometimes their responses are difficult to understand or interpret. When reading aloud, test takers at level 6 are intelligible.",

Responses include problems such as: language that is inaccurate, vague or repetitive; minimal or no awareness of audience; long pauses and frequent hesitations; limited expression of ideas and connections between ideas; limited vocabulary. Most of the time, test takers at level 5 can answer questions and give basic information. However, sometimes their responses are difficult to understand or interpret. When reading aloud, test takers at level 5 are generally intelligible. However, when creating language, their pronunciation, intonation and stress may be inconsistent.",

The response may be limited to a single sentence or part of a sentence. Other problems may include: severely limited language use; minimal or no audience awareness; consistent pronunciation, stress and intonation difficulties; long pauses and frequent hesitations; severely limited vocabulary. Most of the time, test takers at level 4 cannot answer questions or give basic information. When reading aloud, test takers at level 4 vary in intelligibility.

When attempting to explain an opinion, significant weaknesses that interfere with communication occur, such as: not providing enough examples, explanations or details to support the opinion; inadequate organization or connection of ideas; serious grammatical mistakes or incorrect word choices. When giving straightforward information, responses do not successfully complete the task because of missing information or obscure connections. Test takers have some ability to produce grammatically correct sentences, but they are inconsistent.",

When attempting to explain an opinion, the responses show serious flaws such as: serious disorganization or underdevelopment of ideas; little or no detail or irrelevant specifics; serious and frequent grammatical mistakes or incorrect word choices. Responses to tasks requiring straightforward information do not successfully complete the task because of missing information, obscure connections, or many grammatical mistakes.",
